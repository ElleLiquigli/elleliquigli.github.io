    <h1>Steven Universe Fandom</h1>
    <p>Hello, world! Steven Universe is the queerest and most wholesome televsion show in the world.<br />
         You can't help but fall
        in love with the selfless and
        <strong>brave</strong> gems who are constantly defending the Earth from attack... and
        <em>sometimes</em> causing mayhem themselves.<br />
         
        The love and friendship shared by these gems and humans will have you wanting
        to be a Crystal Gem too.</p>

    <h2>Character Development</h2>
    <p>Pearl is one of the characters who experiences the greatest development within the show. She breaks my heart.<br />
        
        Amethyst
        is another character whose growth is so apparent as the show goes on. She becomes so
        <em>mature</em>!</p>
